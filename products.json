The primary limitation is PCI-Express 3.0 at x8 for graphics. Raven Ridge is an unlocked processor, that enabled multiplier we managed to get a proper 3.9 GHz out of the two cores at a voltage of 1.4 volts. One thing you do need to keep in mind is that the memory will be restricted to 2667 MHz maximum (dual-channel).",

    "description": "AMD Ryzen 5 5500 Processor is 6 processor cores, 12 threads, and an astonishingly efficient 45-65W TDP. This processor, It stands with 3.9GHz Base Clock, 4.4GHz Max Boost Clock, 3MB L2 Cache, 16MB L3 Cache with AM4 Package, and TSMC 7nm FinFET CMOS. This processor is built with PCIe 3.0 x8 and Wraith Spire Thermal Solution. The AMD Ryzen 5 5600G Processor provides DDR4 Up to 3200MHz memory with 2 memory channels. It has AMD StoreMI Technology. A fast and easy way to expand and accelerate the storage in a desktop PC with an AMD Ryzen processor. AMD StoreMI technology is a powerful tool for PC enthusiasts that want to improve load times, boot times, file management, or system responsiveness. Whatever your storage acceleration needs, AMD StoreMI technology automatically pairs your most-used files with an SSD cache for peak performance.  MD StoreMI technology can get files running at SSD-like speeds. Simply add an SSD to your system and let StoreMI do the rest. It also has AMD \"Zen 3\" Core Architecture with the fastest cores in the world for PC gamers. The \"Zen 3\" architecture represents the most comprehensive design overhaul of the \"Zen\" era. Over 20 major changes include wider and more flexible execution resources; significantly more load/store bandwidth to feed execution; and a streamlined front-end to get more threads in flight and do it faster. The \"Zen 3\" architecture can extract an average of 19% additional performance from every MHz of frequency relative to the previous generation2. This is a historically large generational improvement in IPC, and a major player in the architectureâ€™s ability to deliver unmatched single-core performance. The \"Zen 3\" architecture transitions to a new \"unified complex\" design that brings 8 cores and 32MB of L3 cache into a single group of resources. This dramatically reduces core-to-core and core-to-cache latencies by making every element of the die a next-door neighbor with minimal communication time. Latency-sensitive tasks like PC gaming especially benefit from this change, as tasks now have direct access to twice as much L3 cache versus the Zen 2. It also features the AMD Ryzen VR-Ready Premium for the best possible VR experiences, AMD offers select Ryzenâ„¢ VR-Ready Premium processors. AMD Ryzen 5 5500 Processor offers a 3-years warranty(No Warranty for Fan or Cooler).",
